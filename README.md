Welcome! This is my offical portfolio site that I am using to showcase my skills.

I used react and tailwind css for everything. During the NuCamp bootcame we learned bootstrap but after seeing several projects done with tailwind I decided to focus on that.

There are also several different imports used like react icons and react scroll. The form in the contact section is being powered by getform.io
